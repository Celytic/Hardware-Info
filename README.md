# Random github thing 
This is my Github account for testing projects and giving feedback. I don't have any coding abilities, so you'll just see me testing things, if anything.

System specs:
Ryzen 7 3700x
32GB DDR4-3200
500gb NVME SSD for main OS
1TB SATA SSD for Windows 10
3TB HDD for storage
Nvidia RTX 2070 Super Founder's Edition running nvidia-proprietary 465.27 driver
OS: Endeavor OS (Arch-based) using the xanmod-5.12.1 kernel. I use Windows 10 for specific software and for games that can't run in Linux due to anticheat compatibility issues.
